PortalFire Framework
====================

A single, core framework for developing multiple sites.  No need to rewrite the same code for every site.  Fast and easy way to setup and run a site.

Let me start by saying, that this framework is a DEVELOPER'S framework.  There is no GUI.  You can easily create one using the Classes in the framework if you like.
I just don't like the bloat, and just wanted a framework that would handle as many domains that I added without rewriting the same code.

##Benefits

- No redundant coding.
- Reuse open connection to database.
- Optimized for page loading.
- Deploy sites quicker.
- Easy to customize.
- Developer mode.
